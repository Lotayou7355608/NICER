Neural Image Correction and Enhancement Routine


Developed during the course of the Master's Thesis "Using Neural Networks as a Metric Towards Optimal Automated Image Enhancement". 

More readme to come soon. 


To install and run this framework, it is recommended that you create a conda environment. If you have anaconda installed, simply do so by typing
`conda create -n my_env'
where my_env is the name of the environment. Afterwards, head over to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally and install the appropriate PyTorch version. In my case, this was: 

conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch


After you successfully installed PyTorch in your environment, clone this repository and do a `pip install -r requirements.txt'.
